##### Installation

Add to your podfile:
```ruby
use_frameworks!
pod 'SwiftCharts', :git => 'https://github.com/i-schuetz/SwiftCharts.git'
```
and then:
```ruby
pod install
```

##### To run examples:

In /Examples, run:
```ruby
pod install
```

##### Concept:

- Layer architecture, which makes it extremely easy to customize charts, create new types, combine existing ones and add interactive elements.

- Creation of views via a generator function, which makes it easy to use custom views in any layer.

##### Main Components:

##### 1. Layers:

A chart is the result of composing layers together. Everything is a layer - axis, guidelines, dividers, line, circles, etc. The idea is to have losely coupled components that can be easily changed and combined in arbitrary ways. This is for example the structure of a basic chart, wich shows a line with circles:

Code:

```swift
let labelSettings = ChartLabelSettings(font: ExamplesDefaults.labelFont)

let chartPoints = [(2, 2), (3, 1), (5, 9), (6, 7), (8, 10), (9, 9), (10, 15), (13, 8), (15, 20), (16, 17)].map{ChartPoint(x: ChartAxisValueInt($0.0), y: ChartAxisValueInt($0.1))}

let xValues = Array(stride(from: 2, through: 16, by: 2)).map {ChartAxisValueInt($0, labelSettings: labelSettings)}
let yValues = Array(stride(from: 0, through: 20, by: 2)).map {ChartAxisValueInt($0, labelSettings: labelSettings)}

let xModel = ChartAxisModel(axisValues: xValues, axisTitleLabel: ChartAxisLabel(text: "Axis title", settings: labelSettings))
let yModel = ChartAxisModel(axisValues: yValues, axisTitleLabel: ChartAxisLabel(text: "Axis title", settings: labelSettings))
let chartFrame = ExamplesDefaults.chartFrame(self.view.bounds)

let chartSettings = ExamplesDefaults.chartSettings
let coordsSpace = ChartCoordsSpaceLeftBottomSingleAxis(chartSettings: chartSettings, chartFrame: chartFrame, xModel: xModel, yModel: yModel)
let (xAxis, yAxis, innerFrame) = (coordsSpace.xAxis, coordsSpace.yAxis, coordsSpace.chartInnerFrame)

// create layer with line
let lineModel = ChartLineModel(chartPoints: chartPoints, lineColor: UIColor(red: 0.4, green: 0.4, blue: 1, alpha: 0.2), lineWidth: 3, animDuration: 0.7, animDelay: 0)
let chartPointsLineLayer = ChartPointsLineLayer(axisX: xAxis, axisY: yAxis, innerFrame: innerFrame, lineModels: [lineModel])

// view generator - creates circle view for each chartpoint
let circleViewGenerator = {(chartPointModel: ChartPointLayerModel, layer: ChartPointsLayer, chart: Chart) -> UIView? in
return ChartPointCircleView(center: chartPointModel.screenLoc, size: CGSizeMake(20, 20), settings: ChartPointCircleViewSettings(animDuration: 0.5))
}
// create layer that uses the view generator
let chartPointsCircleLayer = ChartPointsViewsLayer(axisX: xAxis, axisY: yAxis, innerFrame: innerFrame, chartPoints: chartPoints, viewGenerator: circleViewGenerator, displayDelay: 0, delayBetweenItems: 0.05)

// create layer with guidelines
var settings = ChartGuideLinesDottedLayerSettings(linesColor: UIColor.blackColor(), linesWidth: ExamplesDefaults.guidelinesWidth, axis: .XAndY)
let guidelinesLayer = ChartGuideLinesDottedLayer(axisX: xAxis, yAxis: yAxis, innerFrame: innerFrame, settings: settings)

let chart = Chart(
    frame: chartFrame,
    layers: [
        xAxis,
        yAxis,
        guidelinesLayer,
        chartPointsLineLayer,
        chartPointsCircleLayer
    ]
)

self.view.addSubview(chart.view)
self.chart = chart
```

Layers are semantic units that can add views to the chart, or can simply draw in the chart's context for a better performance. Which makes more sense depends on the requirements.

##### 2. View generators:

View based layers will use a generator function to generate chart point views. This function received the complete state of each chartpoint (model data, screen location) and produces an UIView, allowing any type of customization.

##### Hello world:

There's a [hello world](Examples/Examples/Examples/HelloWorld.swift) included in the examples, similar to the above code, with a bit more explanations. Change some properties of the generated views, copy paste the chartPointsLineLayer used in the snippet above, and pass it to the chart's layers, to display a line behind the views, and you have already mastered the main concepts!

##### Functional concepts:

This library is rather object oriented, but it makes extensive use of functional concepts like high order functions and (preference for) immutability leading to safer code and better maintainability.
